# Installation process:  
Step 1: Copy the contents of 'userscript.js' into your clipboard  
Step 2: If you haven't already, download tapermonkey (https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo//Open)  
Step 3: Press the Extensions icon on the toolbar at the top of your browser and click on the icon that looks like a rounded square with two eyes at the bottom, and press "Dashboard"  
Step 4: Press the little "+" tab, and paste your clipboard contents into the big text box, and click "install".  
Step 5: Open GeoFS, and it should work!  
  
If you _want_ to make your life _harder_, instead of following the installation process, bookmark the userscript.js file and each time you refresh or visit GeoFS, open the bookmark, copy the code, go to the GeoFS tab, press f12, Ctrl+Shift+I, or Cmd+Shift+I, and paste the code into the console.  
  
# Usage  
To toggle slew mode, press 'Y'.  
The forward/backward, left/right, and up/down movement is speed-based, which means to go forward, instead of holding 'I', press 'I'. To speed up, press 'I'. To slow down, and eventually go backward, press 'K'.  
'J' is left, 'L' is right.  
Up/Down movement controls are 'U' and 'Enter' respectively.  
To rotate 5 degrees to your right, press '.' (period); To rotate 5 degrees to your left, press ',' (comma).  
When slew mode is activated, red bold text will appear at the top left of your screen, similar to the slew mode of Microsoft Flight Simulator X.
